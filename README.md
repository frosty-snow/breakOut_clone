# breakOut_clone

This repo holds the code written by me for a Breakout Clone. It uses the SFML library and C++ code. I'm actually rewriting this, to better structure the files and
pull code into appropriate classes to make things more clear and easier to read.

TODO: Add more to this README.md as the project progresses.
