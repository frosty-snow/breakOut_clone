# breakOut_clone

This repo holds the code written by me for a Breakout Clone. It uses the SFML library and C++ code written in Visual Studio 2019.
I undertook this project to gain exposure and working knowledge of the basics of SFML and how to work with it in the Visual Studio ecosystem.
I explored the usage of all the libraries of SFML except networking.

This project was a good short one to cut my teeth on, and often found myself wanting to make it far more complicated than necessary as I learned
some new exciting method for implementating a feature.
In fact, while not implemented in the current state, I do hope my next project with the library can utilize threading to seperate out
my physics simulation, graphical rendering, and user input handling. While likely uncessary for small games such as this, that makes it the
perfect playground to explore and become more experienced with those features and implementations.

Biggest learning point in doing this was focusing on acceptable. I at one point was wanting to do some highly complex linear algebra to 
calculate exactly the change in vector upon collision. While a fun rabbit hole of learning about the winding number algorithm, I quickly
reigned myself in knowing it was overkill for something this simple, and keep that in my back pocket for future projects I would like to
undertake.

Currently my next project planned with this framework is a cool little Mario inspired side scroller. This will up the necessary complexity
and should give me a great sandbox to learn new feature implementations and code organization techniques as the project gets larger.
